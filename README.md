# A/B Testing Analysis: Marketing Campaigns

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes A/B testing results for marketing campaigns to assess the effectiveness of different advertising strategies. Using statistical methods, predictive modeling, and data visualization, the goal is to optimize ad performance and decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains marketing campaign data, including:
- **Date**: Timeline of ad campaigns
- **Facebook Ad Clicks & Conversions**
- **AdWords Ad Clicks & Conversions**
- **Other relevant performance metrics**

## 🔍 Analysis & Methodology
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and formatted data using **Pandas**
- Converted date columns and handled missing values

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions of clicks and conversions with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- Identified trends and patterns across different ad platforms

### 3️⃣ Statistical Testing
- Conducted **A/B hypothesis testing** using **SciPy Stats** to evaluate ad performance
- Checked statistical significance of differences between Facebook and AdWords campaigns

### 4️⃣ Predictive Modeling
- Built **Linear Regression models** to analyze trends in campaign effectiveness
- Evaluated models using **R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

### 5️⃣ Time Series Analysis
- Applied **seasonal decomposition** to uncover trends in campaign performance

## 📈 Key Findings
- Significant differences in performance between Facebook and AdWords campaigns
- Seasonal trends impacting ad effectiveness
- Predictive modeling helps forecast future campaign performance

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, StatsModels, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
